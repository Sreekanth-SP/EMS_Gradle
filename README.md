# EMPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM(EMS_Gradle)
> The employee management system project using Gradle built with Spring Boot can be a versatile and feature-rich platform for users to access and enjoy music in various ways. We have leveraged the capabilities of Spring Boot, along with other powerful dependencies, to ensure a smooth and feature-rich experience for our users
---
## Frameworks And Languages:
The employment management system project is developed using the following frameworks and languages:

* Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building web applications.
* Spring MVC: A module of the Spring Framework that supports building web applications.
* Java: The programming language used for backend development.
* Hibernate: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for database interactions.
* PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system.
---

## Dependencies Used :
The dependencies used in the pom.xml file for this project are :

* Spring Starter Web: Provides essential web-related features and configurations.
* Spring JPA: Simplifies working with relational databases using Java Persistence API (JPA).
* Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code with annotations for getter, setter, and other common methods.
* PostgreSQL Driver: A JDBC and R2DBC driver that allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database-independent Java code.
---
## Data Flow:

* The user interacts with the system through POSTMAN.
* The user's requests are handled by the Spring MVC controllers.
* Data is fetched and manipulated using Spring Data JPA for communication with the PostgreSQL database.
* The database stores employee information, including details such as name, address, and age.
* The user can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.
* The web application communicates with the database using Spring Data JPA.
* Lombok is used to simplify the creation of Java classes by generating boilerplate code.

---
## Database Design:

In the Employee Management System using Spring Boot (MVC) project with PostgreSQL as the database, you can design the database as follows:

Entity: Employee
* id (Primary Key, Auto-generated)
* name (String): The name of the employee.
* Address (String): The address of the employee.
* age (Integer): The age of the employee.
---
## Data Structure:

The project utilizes several data structures, including:

* Strings: Used for storing text-based data, such as user names, and addresses.
* Integers: Used for storing numerical data, such as IDs  and ages.
* ArrayList: To organize and manage data efficiently, such as lists of employee details.
---
## Project Summary:

This Employee Management System is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to manage employee records efficiently. It uses the following key components and technologies:

1. Spring Boot: The core framework for building the application.
1. Spring MVC: Handles web requests and routes them to the appropriate controller.
1. Spring Data JPA: Provides data access and persistence capabilities, simplifying database interactions.
1. PostgreSQL: The relational database used to store and manage employee data.
1. Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, constructors, and other methods for Java classes.

The system allows users to:

* Add new employees with details like name, address and age.
* View a list of all employees.
* Edit employee information.
* Delete employee records.
  
This project aims to demonstrate how to build a basic Employee Management System using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and PostgreSQL as the backend database. You can extend this system by adding additional features and functionality as needed.

---
## Conclusion:
The Employee Management System uses Spring Boot (MVC) with PostgreSQL as the database provides a foundation for managing employee records in a web-based application. This design allows you to efficiently store and retrieve employee data, including their names, email addresses, and departments.
